"Return a new slice object with the given values.  The *start*, *stop*, and "
"*step* parameters are used as the values of the slice object attributes of "
"the same names.  Any of the values may be *NULL*, in which case the ``None``"
" will be used for the corresponding attribute.  Return *NULL* if the new "
"object could not be allocated."
