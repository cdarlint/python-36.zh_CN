"Increment the reference count for object *o*.  The object must not be "
"*NULL*; if you aren't sure that it isn't *NULL*, use :c:func:`Py_XINCREF`."

"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object must not be "
"*NULL*; if you aren't sure that it isn't *NULL*, use :c:func:`Py_XDECREF`.  "
"If the reference count reaches zero, the object's type's deallocation "
"function (which must not be *NULL*) is invoked."
msgstr ""

#: ../../c-api/refcounting.rst:35
msgid ""
"The deallocation function can cause arbitrary Python code to be invoked "
"(e.g. when a class instance with a :meth:`__del__` method is deallocated).  "
"While exceptions in such code are not propagated, the executed code has free"
" access to all Python global variables.  This means that any object that is "
"reachable from a global variable should be in a consistent state before "
":c:func:`Py_DECREF` is invoked.  For example, code to delete an object from "
"a list should copy a reference to the deleted object in a temporary "
"variable, update the list data structure, and then call :c:func:`Py_DECREF` "
"for the temporary variable."

"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be *NULL*, in "
"which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as for "
":c:func:`Py_DECREF`, and the same warning applies."

msgid ""
"Decrement the reference count for object *o*.  The object may be *NULL*, in "
"which case the macro has no effect; otherwise the effect is the same as for "
":c:func:`Py_DECREF`, except that the argument is also set to *NULL*.  The "
"warning for :c:func:`Py_DECREF` does not apply with respect to the object "
"passed because the macro carefully uses a temporary variable and sets the "
"argument to *NULL* before decrementing its reference count."

"It is a good idea to use this macro whenever decrementing the value of a "

"The following functions are for runtime dynamic embedding of Python: "
"``Py_IncRef(PyObject *o)``, ``Py_DecRef(PyObject *o)``. They are simply "
