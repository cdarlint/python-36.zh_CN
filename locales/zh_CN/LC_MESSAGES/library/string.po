"arg_names in a format string are 0, 1, 2, ... in sequence, they can all be "

" possible to specify arbitrary dictionary keys (e.g., the strings ``'10'`` "
"or ``':-]'``) within a format string. The *arg_name* can be followed by any "
"number of index or attribute expressions. An expression of the form "
"``'.name'`` selects the named attribute using :func:`getattr`, while an "

":func:`__getitem__`."
