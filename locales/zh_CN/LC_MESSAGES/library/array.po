"This module defines an object type which can compactly represent an array of"
" basic values: characters, integers, floating point numbers.  Arrays are "
"sequence types and behave very much like lists, except that the type of "
"objects stored in them is constrained.  The type is specified at object "
"creation time by using a :dfn:`type code`, which is a single character.  The"
" following type codes are defined:"
